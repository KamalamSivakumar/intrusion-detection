# intrusion-detection
This project aims to compare the different models used to develop and intrusion detection system using the NSL-KDD dataset.

Exploratory Data Analysis has been performed. 

The feature-selection is done using Random Forest Classifier.

The models compared are:
  1. Logistic Regression
  2. K-NN
  3. Naive-Bayes Classifier
  4. Random Forest Classifier
  5. SVC
